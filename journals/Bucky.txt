	The project started off by meeting during class time to come up with
	user stories in the spirit of Agile and Scrum software development for
	designing a Battleship program.	Dustin Dodson, my project teammate, and
	I spent the hour amongst our fellow classmates brainstorming and 
	committing desired stories to index cards.

	This was quite the exciting time! Ideas were flying between the
	project groups a breakneck pace. One group would consider one feature
	only to decide against it, while another group would take that idea
	and incorporate it into their own project in some manner. All the
	while, professor Hartman would move between the groups and provide
	insight into the process, or emphasize on points from lectures. It 
	was quite the social experience that most of the CS classes did not
	share. One of the best lecture periods during my college career.

	Dustin and I work in the manner of trying to involve a client in the
	feature design. This mostly took the form of one of us providing a leading
	prompt and have the other pick out the desired features from the
	question. For example, I would ask "What kinda interface do you want
	the game to be?" Dustin would then reply that he thought a text based
	game would be good for a start.

	In hind sight, this is not quite the way to pose questions to a
	client. As this type of questioning would lead them into the thoughts
	of how the implementor sees the problem. A more appropriate means for
	flushing out the expectations of a client would be more in tune to
	questions posed as "What do you want to see when you open your game?"
	Know what they say, haven't tried anything new if you don't make
	mistakes.

	At the end of the hour, we had wrote about 15 user stores between the
	both of us. We both noticed that most of the cards contained high
	level ideas about the game. It would make assigning timings and
	complexity rating to the stories difficult. We there for decided to
	communicate over email to setup a meeting over the weekend to break
	down the stories into smaller stories and assign the ratings then.
