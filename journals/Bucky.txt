	The project started off by meeting during class time to come up with
	user stories in the spirit of Agile and Scrum software development for
	designing a Battleship program.	Dustin Dodson, my project teammate, and
	I spent the hour amongst our fellow classmates brainstorming and 
	committing desired stories to index cards.

	This was quite the exciting time! Ideas were flying between the
	project groups a breakneck pace. One group would consider one feature
	only to decide against it, while another group would take that idea
	and incorporate it into their own project in some manner. All the
	while, professor Hartman would move between the groups and provide
	insight into the process, or emphasize on points from lectures. It 
	was quite the social experience that most of the CS classes did not
	share. One of the best lecture periods during my college career.

	Dustin and I work in the manner of trying to involve a client in the
	feature design. This mostly took the form of one of us providing a leading
	prompt and have the other pick out the desired features from the
	question. For example, I would ask "What kinda interface do you want
	the game to be?" Dustin would then reply that he thought a text based
	game would be good for a start.

	In hind sight, this is not quite the way to pose questions to a
	client. As this type of questioning would lead them into the thoughts
	of how the implementor sees the problem. A more appropriate means for
	flushing out the expectations of a client would be more in tune to
	questions posed as "What do you want to see when you open your game?"
	Know what they say, haven't tried anything new if you don't make
	mistakes.

	At the end of the hour, we had wrote about 15 user stores between the
	both of us. We both noticed that most of the cards contained high
	level ideas about the game. It would make assigning timings and
	complexity rating to the stories difficult. We there for decided to
	communicate over email to setup a meeting over the weekend to break
	down the stories into smaller stories and assign the ratings then.

For project meeting on 2014/03/01

	Over email, Dustin and I decided to meet in the CS lab at 1600 for
	flushing out the user stories. We organized them based on a progress
	of the usual use case of the Battleship game. Having decided that the
	game will be text based, the menus of the game should be created
	first. From there, an automatically generated board and layout should
	be presented for two human players to engage at the same computer can
	dual each other. We now had a progression of user stories that we
	wanted to implement first. 

	We decided to have the first user story, making menus, would be used
	as a means to judge the rest of the user stories in complexity as it
	was the first story to implement. We also used the first story as a
	means to provide a sense of how much time should be attributed to each
	story.

	Thus, our first sprint was to make the menu, add some music tracks to
	it, get the underlining system implemented, give the player controls, 
	and then allow them the play a game. At	this point we agreed that the
	index cards containing the user stories should be transfered to a
	Google doc for us both to have access to. Since I've already started
	on a slide deck for this I agreed to type up the cards. By this time
	the meeting had ran approximately an hour. We decided to call it a day
	as we had other assignments to get to. Before leaving we agreed to 
	meet regularly at the CS lab on Monday and Wednesday at 1900 to pair
	program the game.
