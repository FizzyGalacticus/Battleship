3/1/14 - Today is the first day that Bucky and I have met since the beginning of the project assignment. We are currently going through user stories and figuring out a good priority/time value for each one. We have so far got the first sprint prioritized and with some guestimated time values for each feature that we wish to add. Base features (in order from first to last priority) are: Menu system, add basic audio, create a coordinate system, create a ship system (with traditional ships first), player controls, and (hopefully) after that, we should be able to throw together the base game. 

3/3/14 - Today we started our first "sprint." We wrote the main menu and the pause menu, which were pretty simple, considering we are just using STDOUT in the console for now. We wrote a main function to test the menu system with. Then we decided to get some basic sound working. Created a class called Sound and made it play basic background noise (I call it noise because it's only a small clip, not actually music). We made functions to pause and unpause all sounds. I was going to move all implementation of this class to a child class, that way we could have a class strictly for background music and another for sound effects, but I spent HOURS trying to get my source to compile on my Linux machine (Ubuntu 12.04 x64). Aparently it's a huge pain in the ass to compile source on a 64-bit machine when you're using 32-bit libraries. Finally got it working... although the sound is a bit splotchy... BUT IT WORKS. Hopefully we won't have too many more problems keeping this project cross-platform. I'm still trying to find a suitable substitute for getch(), considering that conio.h is a Windows only library. We've been considering using the NCurses library for console I/O, and supposedly it has a getch() function. We'll see.

3/4/14 - Today we started working on the base outline of our grid system, or Board class. So far we can create a board, give it a size (although it is 9x9 by default), and print it to the screen. Most of our time was spent thinking about how we wanted to structure the class, and drawing on the whiteboard. We're still trying to figure out exactly how the ships and the Board will interact, but we think that the Board will just hold Ship objects, and go from there.

3/5/14 - Today we refactored our sound class, creating two derived classes. One will be strictly for background music, and the other for our sound effects. 

3/6/14 - Spent most of today working on the class that takes care of background music. The library is proving to be a huge pain in the rear. I cannot figure out how to use non-static member variables of a class within a static function...or vise versa. It just will not let me for some reason. There is this one line of code that will not compile, and it keeps telling me that I cannot call the function without the object, even though the object should have been constructed at this point. I have no freaking idea.
