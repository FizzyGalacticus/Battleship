3/1/14 - Today is the first day that Bucky and I have met since the beginning of the project assignment. We are currently going through user stories and figuring out a good priority/time value for each one. We have so far got the first sprint prioritized and with some guestimated time values for each feature that we wish to add. Base features (in order from first to last priority) are: Menu system, add basic audio, create a coordinate system, create a ship system (with traditional ships first), player controls, and (hopefully) after that, we should be able to throw together the base game.
